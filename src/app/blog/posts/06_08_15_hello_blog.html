      <p>Here it is. My first blog post. Ever.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yes I know, I'm a bit late... but as we say, <q>better late than never</q>!

        It's been a long time since I had the idea to create my own blog. But I never took the step.
        Every time I was talking about it, people said "Just create a wordpress, it's easy ! It would take you just an hour to have your blog online !"
        In fact, I created a wordpress once. But I did not post anything... I did not like the idea of wordpress. Don't get me wrong, it is a wonderfull tool.
         And I know a lot of people that are happy about it. But as a developper, I wanted to create my own blog. And by create, I mean doing it myself, with my own hands.

      That's what I did here. I was in vacancy for the week, and I had time to spend on it. So I decided to create my own website.
      It was (and is) quite a chalenge for me. I'm a C++ developper, I've never done this before... Yeah, right, I've done some <del>good</del> old JSP at work,
      but that was just hacking into an existing source code, and it's a completely different technology. Here I used Angular combined with Bootstrap, as my
      web dev' friends told me. They helped me a lot by the way...

      Anyway. That's not what this blog will be about. I'm a passionate C++ developper, and I do a lot of things in <em>my day to day programming</em> that I want to share with you.
      It could be a post about one of my (never ending) side projects, or about a library that I wanted to test, or even just a link to a post from another blog that I liked.

      To illustrate this, and as a conclusion, I want to share with you a CommitStrip from last year. I think it's the perfect representation of my side projects :
