    <h3>About me</h3>
    <p>
      I am a passionate C++ developer from Lyon - France. I have a master degree of Applied Mathematics with a specialization in statistical modeling, so it is not my original domain. However, I have always been attracted by programming, that's why I choose the path of applied maths instead of theoretical maths.

      I started my work experience with the MaximiZen project, aiming at creating a website providing financial portfolio risk management capabilities to its users. Although there already exist a lot of those websites, they only provide simple (not to say archaic) methods. The goal of MaximiZen was to provide cutting-edge mathematical algorithms to everyone.
      <br>
      The project was splitted in two parts : the "scientific" part developped by our team, and the "website" part developped by another company.
      Our part was driven by one of my teachers from the university of Besançon, Juan-Pablo Ortega, which is an "enseignant-chercheur" from CNRS (Centre National de Recherche Scientifique). He is a specialist in time series modeling, and was in charge of the "cutting-edge maths" part. When I left my job, our part was done. We had a fully functionnal C++ library providing (ARMA-GARCH) time series modeling functionnalities, a lot of different Value-at-Risk computations, portfolio optimization, financial instruments pricing, etc. Unfortunately, the website part never took off, I don't know why...
      <br>
      This was a really rewarding experience for me. I learnt a lot in time series modelling, and that was my first real C++ project.

      When I left Besançon for Lyon, as Lyon is quite a big city, I thought it would be easy to find a new Job. Unfortunately, that was not the case. First because there are not so many jobs that mix applied maths with development, and second because I have not the line on my resume, saying that I know how to program in C++. But with some time, I finally found a job in Tech'Advantage, a tech' subsidiary of IFPen (Institut Français du Pétrole et des énergies nouvelles).
      <br>
      My job was to write a COM dll for process simulators (a <a href="http://www.colan.org/" class="link">Cape-Open</a> plugin) alowing to rigorously simulate the evolution of an amine regenerator. In fact, they had a proof of concept in Fortran, and I had to translate it in industrial quality C++ code.
      <br>
      My second project was an evolution on an internal thermodynamic library (used by a lot of selled products, like the one I wrote before).
      <br>
      These two projects were really interesting. Not just because it was in C++ and that's my favorite language, but also because of the scientific domain. As I said before, I'm comming from applied mathematics, and I love science. But I also love programming, so if my job is at the frontier of the two disciplines, I'm a happy man.

      This is it. This is my past experience as a C++ developer. But I'm kind of lying to you now... Unfortunately, since about a year now, the projects I'm working on are not in C++, and not really about science... That's why I'm starting to search for a new job. So, if you have an opportunity in Lyon that may interest me, please <a href="mailto:chevassu.florian@gmail.com?subject=Job opportunity" class="link">contact me</a>! I would love to discuss with you about our possible collaboration.
